# Balanced Approach

* some "assembly" is always required
  * integrating paid tools
  * deploying free tools
  * automation component
* Mix build and buy to meet your OSINT goals

Easy Examples:

* Buy
  * &#x20;**internet-sized attack surface data** -- _building this would involve scanning billions of hosts, cost lots in hosting, and require lots of development to enrich the data to make it usable. and Shodan is quite affordable_
* Build
  * **profile enumeration by username (demo)** -- there are tons of ways to do this, and it's relatively straightforward
  * **anything that doesn't exist already** -- _you have no other options..._
