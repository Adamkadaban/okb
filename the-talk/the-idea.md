# The Idea

### OSINT is easy! But there's so much out there...

* nearly infinite amount of data available
* difficult to judge quality of data
* lots of tasks require human brains, manual effort

### Existing OSINT resources lack curation

* huge lists of links (guilty)
* difficult to see return data types/capabilities ahead of time
* for beginners, difficult to map tools to specific workflows
  * _example: business email enumeration_

Time wasters:

* For free products, getting tools running can take time
  * keys, deployment, proxying, etc
* Hosted tools often have limitations
* For paid products, cost/benefit

We also have to decide between building it ourselves, using existing tools, or just paying for a commercial product.

### Solution:

* operators build their list of "go-to" tools over time based on experience
* why not share this experience?&#x20;
