# The Solution (hopefully)

* operators build their list of "go-to" tools over time based on experience
* why not share this experience?&#x20;

**This site!! have you noticed my slides are on gitbook? it's public.**

* Please contribute (more info on that later)

Focus on metrics, fallback to opinions where metrics don't make sense

* for example, can compare certain tools by number of results and accuracy of results
* cannot review training this way
